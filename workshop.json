  "Description": "PRERELEASE VERSION - NOT FINAL\n\nEnjoying the grind too little? Qud too easy to navigate? Feel bad about kithing someone and then mugging them for all they're worth? Try Caves of Conduct - a fully optional way to spice up your runs!\n\n[h2]What[/h2]\nThis mod adds a single menu: find Open Conducts in Keybinds > Status and bind it to (for example) Ctrl-O. This menu simply brings up a list of conducts that you can follow; any conducts you followed also show up in your death log when you die (TODO: This is not yet implemented).\n\n[h2]Do they do anything, though?[/h2]\n\nConducts serve no purpose other than bragging rights, but what bragging rights they are - making it to the Moon Stair combatless is amazing anyway.\n\n[h2]Can I add my own Conducts?[/h2]\n\nOf course! When Caves of Conduct is loaded, any mod with a Conducts.xml file will have their own conducts added to the game. (See the given Conducts.xml for details.) Make a conduct for only fighting with a rubber chicken! Prevent yourself from moving except when propelled by explosives! The possibilities are endless!",
